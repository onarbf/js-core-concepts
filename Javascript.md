A multi-[[Paradigm]] software development language.


A good definition:

JS is an implementation of the [[ECMAScript]] standard (version ES2019 as of this writing), which is guided by the [[TC39]] committee and hosted by ECMA. It runs in browsers and other JS environments such as Node.js.

JS is a multi-[[Paradigm]] language, meaning the syntax and capabilities allow a developer to mix and match (and bend and reshape!) concepts from various major paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented (OO/classes), and functional (FP).

JS is a compiled language, meaning the tools (including the JS engine) process and verify a program (reporting any errors!) before it executes.

With our language nowÂ _defined_, let's start getting to know its ins and outs.
